# Time is Money

## Abstract
I want to talk about the link between money, time, value. How this has shaped humanity from time immemorial to now. Then I want to talk about inequaility we see in our current life. How I feel inevitable inequality is right now and the reasons for it. I do not have any answers but just more questions which we need to ponder.

## Definition of money
I got this from google.
> Money is any object that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a given country or socio-economic context.

## 
The total sum of value of human kind is the sum of time saved for each person (the time that person would have had to spend to do all the things themselves in their life independently).

In a just world, if a person (does a service)/(create a tool) which saves another person X time. 
The first person is entitled that X time. We created this concept of money to keep track of this saved time.

Let's name the amount of time saved as VALUE.
 
The amount of time a person could save used to be very limited in prehistoric times. As we advanced, we created tools to enable us to save time for more people. Certain tools and technology created a leap in the amount of people you could save time and hence save more time. Some of them were
1. Language
2. Agriculture
3. Writing
4. Printing press
5. Industrialization 
6. Internet

If we look at Value (hence money) as a function of Time(time saved), value starts to look to be finite and one person having more than another actually starts affecting the average cost of things. (If this doesn't make total sense right now, it is ok.)

Let us define the term throughput as the amount of human hours saved. 

If everyone's throughput is the same, then there will be no inequality (in a perfect world). For example lets take human's basic needs, Food, shelter, safety and lets consider the tasks.
If people had to do these tasks on their own, all of their time is used up and they have no free time. (Let's say everyone spends 9 hours doing tasks, 3 hours for cooking, 3 hours for building and 3 hours practicing defense)
Let us say there are 3 people who specialize in the above tasks Vineet (Cooks great  food with 3x efficiency), Tejas (Builder - builds great houses with 3x efficiency ) and Manjya (Knows karate and can fight off 3 people).
Let us assume for simplicity sake, each task takes the same amount of time.

As each person is a specialist, they can do the work faster and as a team. 
Vineet cooks for all 3. (in 3 hours he can cook for 3 people)
Tejas builds infrastructure and maintains it (houses/roads) for all 3. (in 3 hours he can build/maintain for 3 people)
Manjya can fight off invaders. (in 3 hours, he can train to fend off for 3 people)

The result of working as a team is 
1. Throughput of each is the same, 6. ( Each saved others 6 hours in total (3 + 3))
	1. There is no inequality now as every one produces same output.
	2. Each person has saved 6 hours 
2. 2/3rd of the time of each individual  is freed up. 
	1. Each person has now 6 hours of free time everyday
	2. Each person can do extra curricular activities or they can do cook/build/protect for more people if they join the tribe.

Let's say one more person joins the Tribe, Aditi, she specializes in cooking.

Now the throughput is not the same as the supply of cooks is more than demand compared to building and defence. This is the start of inequality.

Let's say the tribe gets 1 more people, Aditi (Cook) joins the tribe. She is a great cook too.

Now there is an imbalance in specialists. 
2 cooks, 1 fighter, 1 builder.

The 2 cooks can no longer use their full potential as they can cook for  people but only 7 are there.
So the amount of time saved by cooks now is much lesser than the other specialist jobs.

There is inequality now. Fighters and builders produce more output than the cooks per individual. 

But now Aditi or Vineet can now learn new skills, say providing entertainment/building tools/inventing new technologies to make efficiency of the basic tasks better etc. 

To better keep track of time saved and use each other's service, we developed the concept of money.

Each person can buy the service he wants by using this money.

When you save time of multiple people from doing a task by themselves, you generally gain that time saved as money.

If everyone's throughput is the same, then there is no in equality as we talked about earlier. But that doesn't happen generally, as we keep saving time to tasks, we need to find new things to keep the throughput everyone's fairly equal. Else inequality keeps increasing.

Also till now we have assumed everyone's skill level is the same. But that is not the case in the real world.

If look at the distribution of throughput of the population, by pure skill, some people are better than others and worse than others.

So their throughput is also affected by this.

In prehistoric times, as there was less technology, the throughput was mostly a function of skill. As most people were creating similar throughput.

But as people had more free time, we started innovating more. Innovation increases efficiency of certain tasks and hence increases throughput but it also deflates the value of doing that task. 
By deflation I mean the value/price of that good/service is lowered.

As the we start increasing the efficiency of a task, the time saved by people doing that particular task keeps increasing and increasing and hence the person who innovates is entitled to some of the time saved due to the innovation.

Now you can see that innovation slowly starts increasing inequality.

Generally inequality is fine if the basic needs of people are taken care of. (we can argue about what are the basic needs but that is not the point).

But when inequality crosses a certain threshold, then some people in the lower bracket struggle to have money to buy basic needs.

Also the cost of each task also increases as available resources decrease. Housing/food becomes expensive as population increases.

Let's pause here and talk about how some invention/discovery of technologies have deflated value of things.
1. Language
2. Agriculture
3. Writing
4. Industrialization
5. Internet
#### Language
We were able to transfer knowledge to one another and hence we did not need to conceptualize that independently. (We were able to communicate efficiently too, i am not discounting that). This deflated the value of knowledge

#### Agriculture
One person was able to feed many people, this deflated the value of food.

#### Writing
One person could share knowledge to more people as he didn't have to spend his time talking to people. This deflated value of knowledge more

#### Industrialization
One person through industrialization could create tools much faster and share tools with the world. This deflated the value of tools

#### Internet
One person could share knowledge to the whole world instantly. This deflated the value of communication and knowledge to a great extent.

So as innovation speeds up, inequality speeds up too. Even with inequality we can argue that people's lives are better off than how it was 1000 years ago.

That is because the basic needs of people have been deflated so much that the needs like food and safety is taken care of for cheap. 
One of the reasons people many people are having a bad time is because housing which is a basic need has not deflated as the other basic needs and it still costs a lot. As there are a lot of humans per available land. The cost of this has not reduced when compared to safety and food.

Then you have the efficiency of some tasks are becoming exponential as with the current technology one person can save time of billions.  For example, Google gives you access to the most up to date information about to do a task in seconds. 10,000 employees in google save hours or days for time for billions of people all over the world.

Now these people are entitled just from pure market value perspective, that much amount of time saved. So we have some one working in google for 8 hours a day and save time of billions and then we have a some one who works in McDonalds and works for 8 hours and saves time of 100 people.

As time of all humans combined is a limited quantity, in this current age, one person can save time of millions/billions and we have jobs which can affect 1-100 people. Now because of this we have inequality. Again inequality is fine until all basic needs are deflated.
